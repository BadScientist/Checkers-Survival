# Checkers-Survival
Checkers Studios survival game project for CS 361.

Disaster! Once assigned the prestigious task of establishing a Research Outpost orbiting an alien planet to study the technologically rudimentary humanoids, a mechanical failure rendered you unable to reach a stable orbit over the planet. You had no choice but to enter the planet's rich atmosphere and crash landed on one of its landmasses.

Hunt, Work with friendly natives, Brave the planet's hazards - but by all means... Survive.
